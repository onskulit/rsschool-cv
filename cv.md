## About me

I am 23 years old, the last year I have been working as a procurement specialist in the Russian branch of an Italian energy company. Before that, I worked for a year as a project manager in a design company.

I started to develop myself in programming, as I realized that at work it's not enough for me to use only soft skills. I want to feel like I'm using my full potential, doing something worthwhile and meaningful. Ever since I started learning programming, I feel like my brain is working to its fullest. This gives me great pleasure!

I believe that using my personal qualities I can achieve a lot in development.

## Skills

* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript Basics
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code

## Code Examples

**Assignment:** There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

```
function findUniq(arr) {
  let sortedArray = arr.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  if (sortedArray[0] < sortedArray[1]) {
    return sortedArray[0];
  } else if (sortedArray[sortedArray.length - 2] < sortedArray[sortedArray.length - 1]) {
    return sortedArray[sortedArray.length - 1];
  }
}
```
