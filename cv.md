## About me

I am 24 years old, the last year I have been working as a procurement specialist. Before that, I worked for a year as a project manager in a design company.

I started to develop myself in programming, as I realized that at work it's not enough for me to use only soft skills. I want to feel like I'm using my full potential, doing something worthwhile and meaningful. Ever since I started learning programming, I feel like my brain is working to its fullest. This gives me great pleasure!

I believe that using my personal qualities I can achieve a lot in programming.

  let sum = a.length;
  
  for (let element of a) {
    if (Array.isArray(element)) {
      sum += deepCount(element);
    }
  }
    
  return sum;
